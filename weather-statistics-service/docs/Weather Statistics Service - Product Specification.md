# Weather Statistics Service - Product Specification (for Farm Use)

## 1. Introduction

This document details the enhanced Weather Statistics Service, presenting its advanced analytical capabilities and data retention features designed to provide the farm with deep, data-driven insights into regional weather patterns and their long-term impact on operations.

## 2. Problem Solved by this Service

Beyond basic averages, farms need specialized metrics and access to historical data for detailed analysis and future planning. Manually calculating complex metrics and storing vast amounts of raw data is impractical. This service automates sophisticated calculations based on available sensor data and reliably stores every raw reading for future use.

## 3. Value Proposition for the Farm

The enhanced Weather Statistics Service transforms available raw weather data into comprehensive agronomic intelligence and provides a valuable historical archive. By automatically calculating metrics vital for crop development (like GDD) and tracking critical events, while simultaneously preserving a complete history of all readings, it empowers farm personnel with both real-time insights and the data needed for in-depth historical analysis and strategic long-term decisions.

## 4. Key Features Provided by this Service (Enhanced)

* **Real-time Raw Data Processing:** Continuously consumes and processes incoming raw weather data.
* **Sophisticated Time Window Statistics:** Calculates detailed statistics within defined time intervals using only the available fields, including:
    * Average, Min, Max, and **Rate of Change** for temperature, humidity, and pressure.
    * Read counts per sensor and poor air quality counts.
    * **Counts and Duration of critical temperature events** (e.g., time spent below freezing, above heat stress thresholds).
* **Cumulative Agronomic Metrics:** Tracks and reports values accumulated over longer periods based on available data:
    * **Growing Degree Days (GDD):** Provides a cumulative measure of heat accumulation relevant to crop development stages.
* **Complete Raw Data History:** **Reliably stores every single raw weather data reading** in a dedicated database for long-term retention, future analysis, and auditing.
* **Structured Aggregated Output:** Publishes all calculated statistics in a clear format.
* **Operational Monitoring:** Provides detailed logging for pipeline health.

## 5. Benefits for the Farm (Enhanced)

* **Advanced Agronomic Insights:** Use GDD and detailed temperature event metrics to precisely time farming activities and manage crop health.
* **Proactive Risk Management:** Identify and quantify critical conditions (frost, heat, air quality) in real-time and understand their cumulative impact (duration).
* **Data-Driven Planning:** Access to historical raw data enables in-depth analysis of past seasons, informing future crop selection, field management, and risk assessment.
* **Support for Future Analytics & ML:** The complete raw data history provides a rich dataset for training machine learning models or performing complex ad-hoc analyses not covered by current aggregations.
* **Compliance & Auditing:** Maintain a verifiable record of all environmental conditions.
* **Increased Efficiency:** Automates complex calculations and data archiving.

## 6. Scope (Specific to this Service - Enhanced)

The scope includes consuming raw data, implementing the defined sophisticated time-windowed and cumulative aggregation logic (specifically GDD and temperature-based duration/counts), persisting the raw data history in a NoSQL database, persisting cumulative state (GDD) in a separate database, and publishing the aggregated results. It relies on a separate component for providing raw data and another for consuming the aggregated output.

## 7. Potential Future Enhancements (Product/Feature Level - More Sophisticated)

* Build tools or integrate with platforms for querying and visualizing the raw data history.
* Implement alerting based on sophisticated metrics (e.g., GDD milestones reached, duration of extreme temperatures exceeding a threshold).
* Integrate with predictive models that utilize the raw data history and sophisticated metrics.
* Analyze relationships between historical weather patterns (using raw data history) and crop yields or disease outbreaks.
* Develop reports based on aggregated statistics and historical raw data.
